This is a CD player for use under Acme.

It is derived from my earlier cdplay, which
was in turn derived from a 2nd edition player
called vcd.  I think hardly any of the code from
vcd is left anymore, but it's what got me started.
Vcd was originally by David Hogan with additions
by Alberto Nava.  David Hogan claims the only
code left is the definition of struct Msf.

Run it by executing "acd /dev/sdD0", where
/dev/sdD0 is your CD reader.

A window with a track list will appear, with
tracks named Track 1, Track 2, etc.
If it can be found in the freedb.org CD database,
real track names will replace the boring
ones before long.

To start playing a track, right click the number.
A "> " marks the currently playing track.
When that track finishes, acd plays the track
on the next line.  This means you can edit
the window as thought it were a play list.

If the next line is "repeat", acd will start again
at the first song listed in the window.

CD changes are handled gracefully.
