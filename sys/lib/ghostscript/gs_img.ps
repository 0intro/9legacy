% image, colorimage, and imagemask implementation

%
% The design of the overprint facility in Ghostscript requires that color
% specifications include the color space from which they were expressed,
% even after conversion to the device color model. Directly including this
% information in color specifications is usually not efficient, and is
% difficult to integrate into the existing code structure. The alternative
% approach taken is to extend a state mechanism through the device
% interface, and make the current color space, or more specifically,
% certain information about the current color space, a property of this
% state.
%
% For such a mechanism to work, it is necessary to identify all changes
% to the current color space. This is accomplished in the graphic library
% by funneling all changes to the current color space through the
% gs_setcolorspace procedure. At the PostScript interpreter level, this
% result is achieved by forcing color space changes through the
% setcolorspace operator.
%
% Aside from explicit use of setcolorspace, PostScript provides a few
% implicit methods of changing the current color space. The setgray,
% setrgbcolor, and setcmykcolor operators implicitly set the color space
% while explicitly setting the current color. Similarly, the colorimage
% operator and the traditional form of the image operator (5 operands)
% both temporarily modify the current color space while an image is
% being processed. The current file is concerned with the implementation
% of these two operators. In addition, the traditional form of the
% imagemask operator (5 operands), while it does not affect the current
% color space, is closely related to the image operator and thus is
% implemented in this file as well.
%
% In this implementation, all sampled objects are passed through one of
% the internal operators .image1, .imagemask1, .image1alpha, .image2,
% .image3, or .image4, each of which handles a specific ImageType value.
%
% The procedures in this file are responsible for constructing
% image dictionaries from a set of stack entries. This is, in principle,
% a trivial exercise. In practice it appears to be far more complex,
% primarily due to the need to reconstruct the original state in the
% event of an error. This is a particular problem for operators such as
% image, which include data source objects that may, directly or
% indirectly, be procedures. When these procedures are executed, the
% image operator's operands must have been cleared from the operand
% stack. Hence, the operand stack cannot be used to store state
% information. Similarly, the dictionary stack also cannot be used to
% store state information, as the data source procedures may depend on
% a particular dictionary being on the top of this stack.
%
% Adobe's PostScript implementations determine the extent to which the
% interpreter state is restored in the event of an error by the point at
% which the error is detected. Errors in the image/colorimage/imagemask
% operators that are detected before the data source procedures are
% executed restore the state in effect before the image was processed.
% Those that are detected as part of running the data source procedures
% only attempt to restore the state to that in effect at the start of
% the operator that failed (or at the conclusion of the data source
% procedure, if this procedure failed to push a string).
%
% The implementation given here follows the Adobe convention. The
% mechanism used is as follows:
%
%   1. Check that the stack has a sufficient number of operands, and
%      that enough of them have the proper type to allow construction
%      of the image dictionary. Any errors at this point are handled
%      in the conventional manner.
%
%   2. Build the image dictionary, in the process clearing the image/
%      colorimage/imagemask operands from the stack. No errors can
%      occur during this process.
%
%      (Special precautions could be taken during this step to handle
%      a limitcheck or VMError during the building of the image
%      dictionary, but this essentially never occurs in practice and, if
%      it did, is very unlikely to leave a useable state. Hence, we don't
%      bother with this possibility.)
%
%   3. The .image operator is executed in a stopped context. If it
%      returns abnormally, a check is made to see if the uppermost
%      operand on the stack is a color image dictionary. If so, the
%      original stack is created anew using this dictionary. (Because
%      the image operand works via colorimage, some additional special
%      handling is required in this case.)
%


%
% Create a dictionary of operators for specific image and image mask types.
% Each of these will always handle ImageType 1. Additional types are added
% as they are supported in specific interpreter levels or versions.
%
% These dictionaries are in systemdict for historical reasons.

%
% Some useful local data structures:
%
%   img_csary maps the number of components in an image to the implied
%       color space.
%
%   img_decary is a prototype Decode array; subintervals of this array
%       may be used for fewer than 4 color components.
%
%   img_params_ary is a list of the parameters to be built in the image
%       dictionary for a colorimage invocation. ImageType is given a
%       fixed value; the other parameters are in stack order (IMG_NComps
%       is the number of components).
%
%   img_mask_params_ary is the equivalent of img_params_ary for imagemask
%       invocations. Polarity is a proxy for Decode, and is replaced
%       by the Decode key in the image dictionary.
%
%   img_mask_check_ary is the set of parameters that must be present in
%       an image dictionary generated by an imagemask invocation. This
%       differs from img_mask_params_ary in that Decode replaces Polarity.

% Error handling for these operators is a bit complex, due to the stack
% handling required of operators that potentially invoke procedures.
% This problem is discussed in the comment above. The facts relevant to
% this particular implementation are:
%
%   1. The .image1 (or .alphaimage) operator is executed in a stopped
%      context, so that we can undo the gsave context in the event of
%      an error.
%
%   2. In the event of an error, the stack is examined to see if the
%      dictionary passed to .image1 (.alphaimage) is still present.
%      If so, this dictionary is "unpacked" onto the stack to re-
%      create the original stack. The <has_alpha> parameter is not
%      pushed onto the stack, as it is not required for any of the
%      pseudo-operators than invoke this procedure.
%
%   3. The use of pseudo-operators in this case may yield incorrect
%      results for late-detected errors, as the stack depth will be
%      restored (even though the stack is not). This is, however, no
%      worse than the prior (level >= 2) code, so it should cause no
