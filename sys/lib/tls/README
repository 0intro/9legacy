By convention, the owner of a file here defines the policy for
adding entries;  please send email to request additions, so that
some consistency can be maintained.

Thus, the postmaster will maintain in /sys/lib/tls/mail the thumbprint,
i.e. the SHA-1 checksum of the mail server's X.509 certificate, for
services that are locally considered trusted for IMAPS.
