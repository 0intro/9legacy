This directory contains source code for two PowerPC ports,

The kernel made with
	mk 'CONF=blast'
is an 8260 kernel.  The 8260 (PowerQuick II) is an embedded PowerPC
with on-chip DMA, Uart, Ethernet, ATM controllers and a few other things.

The 8260-specific code is in m8260.c (no surprises there) and in the
device drivers for SMC uart (uartsmc.c) and FCC ethernet (etherfcc.c).

The kernel made with
	mk 'CONF=ucu'
is a PowerPC 750/755 kernel using the saturn chip for Ether and Uart.

We run both kernels on Lucent proprietary boards, but the kernels are
pretty generic.  On a different board, the ports may be hooked up differently,
the clocks may be running at different speeds, the memory banks may be
configured differently and this will require tweaking the Ethernet setup,
Uart setup, Memory bank setup and several other things as well.

There is 8260 and Ucu specific code in l.s too (lucu.s and lblast.s).
These differences primarily concern the state of the system at bootup.
In the case of the ucu, virtual memory is already on when the kernel
starts.

Questions to Sape or Pb (@plan9.bell-labs.com).  No whining, however,
you're lucky to be looking at this code at all.
