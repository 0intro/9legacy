This directory contains the virgin patch source on the vendor branch.  Do
not under any circumstances commit new versions onto the mainline, new
versions or official-patch versions must be imported.

To prepare a new patch dist for import, extract it into a fresh directory
and remove the following files (and any others that are non-FreeBSD
specific):

memchr.c
mkinstalldirs
pc/*
rename.c

The only other change that was made to the original tarball was to
rename patch.man to patch.1.

patch has RCS Id, Name and Header tags. It needs to be imported with -ko.

It is imported from it's top level directory something like this:
  cvs -n import -ko src/contrib/patch FSF patch_<version>

The -n option is "don't do anything" so you can see what is about to happen
first.  Remove it when it looks ok.

The initial import was done with:
  cvs import -ko src/contrib/patch FSF patch_2_4

When new versions are imported, cvs will give instructions on how to merge
the local and vendor changes when/if conflicts arise..
