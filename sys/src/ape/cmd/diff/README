This directory contains the GNU diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp utilities.
Their features are a superset of the Unix features and they are
significantly faster.  cmp has been moved here from the GNU textutils.

See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
See the file diff.texi (or diff.info*) for documentation.
See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.
