This bootstrap is intended to load a Plan 9 kernel via bootp and tftp
into a Xilinx Virtex 4 ML410 board.  It shares code with the ML510
boot in ../vt5.  The mkfile generates an elf file which is then fed
into the Xilinx CAD tool to generate a bitstream for loading into the
FPGA on the ML410.

This bootstrap will almost certainly not work for you without some
changes.  In particular, the addresses of the I/O registers in
physmem.h will have to be changed to match yours and you'll need to
make sure that they are mapped if you have more than 512K of them.

This bootstrap does not use dma but in principle it could, by
replacing calls to fifocpy with calls to dmacpy.  dma is one more
thing that could go wrong, so we ended up using the cpu to copy words
to and from ethernet fifos.

This code runs in high memory (above 0xfffe0000) and its global data
is thus in sram.  On the Virtex 4, the bootstrap runs with the MMU off.
