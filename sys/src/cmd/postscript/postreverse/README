A simple program that reverses the pages in PostScript files that
conform to Adobe's Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 file structuring
conventions.

postrevese also handles a small class of files that violate page
independence (eg. output from dpost) and can be used with all the
translators in this package. The output can be conforming even if
the input file wasn't.
