	* main.c (close_and_set_permissions): Inability to change output
	  file attributes has been downgraded from error to warning.

	  multimember file when only one '-v' is specified.
	* encoder.h (Lee_update_prices): Update high length symbol prices
	  independently of the value of 'pos_state'. This gives better
	  compression for large values of '--match-length' without being
	  slower.
	* encoder.h encoder.c: Optimize pair price calculations. This
	  reduces compression time for large values of '--match-length'
	  by up to 6%.

2011-01-11  Antonio Diaz Diaz  <ant_diaz@teleline.es>

	* Version 1.1 released.
