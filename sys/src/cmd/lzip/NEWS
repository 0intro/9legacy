Changes in version 1.9:

The option '-l, --list' has been ported from lziprecover.

It is now an error to specify two or more different operations in the
command line (--decompress, --list or --test).

Compression time of option '-0' has been reduced by 6%.

Compression time of options '-1' to '-9' has been reduced by 1%.

Decompression time has been reduced by 7%.

In test mode, clzip now continues checking the rest of the files if any
input file is a terminal.

Trailing data are now shown both in hexadecimal and as a string of
printable ASCII characters.

Three missing chapters have been added to the manual, which now contains
all the chapters of the lzip manual.
