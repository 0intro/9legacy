Use openocd on a fake GURU to see reset
Unknown

Fix start

Fix the sheeva nsrst must be asserted while stopping/cpuiding
but this is just for the feroceon, an extra reset state before
cpuid/request. The order is strictly this:

- UNTESTED
reset 0 1
cpuid
set DBGRQ
reset 0 0
wait halt

It may work to break it into:
reset 0 1
cpuid
reset 0 0

and

reset 0 1
set DBGRQ
reset 0 0


Put currentch inside the tap description in an Armtap state.

Add a ctl to identify the motherboard, not sure how to call initmpsse...
break it in two pieces maybe.
Identify which part is board dependant.

Get more info about the GURU display.
