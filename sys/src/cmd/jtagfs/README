change attachproc in libmach so that we can modify the kernel
registers.

recompile libmach and acid
It could also be done through acid using map(), but in this case
it is better this way.

The armada implementation has never been run even once.


Byte endianness. As it is now, it depends on endianness of ARM being the
same as 386. Specifically, the /proc served is in the machine where it runs
order (i.e. in a little endian machine it would not work). This should be
changed on jtagfs, just before serving them.

MMU state is served after the Uregs (there is no floating point, if not, it would
be after the floating point too). A map has been added to map it in read only.
