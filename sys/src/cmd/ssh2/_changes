still work to be done!
but the worst maintainability problems are fixed.

work still to be done (not exhaustive):
use dial(2) routines instead of manual diddling
use factotum and auth_* routines

fixed bugs
	systemic bugs like overflow at both ends in
		n = read(n, buf, sizeof buf);
		buf[n] = 0;
	fixed unchecked malloc calls
replaced many magic numbers with named constants
	see magic.out for remainder
duplicated code broken out into functions
	see dup.* for remaining offenders
	use readio & writeio throughout
big functions broken up
	see long.funcs for remaining offenders
converted to plan 9 style
	*File -> Q* per all other file servers
	very long lines wrapped for finite-width devices
use syslog in daemons
added /net/ssh/*/tcp containing number of the underlying tcp connection
	originally for sshswitch, see _coexistence-is-futile
edited manual page for clarity and brevity, split in two
worked out problems with normal usage cases, fixed or documented them
