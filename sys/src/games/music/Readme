The Plan 9 Jukebox consists of three applications: a play-list server, a browse server
and a GUI:
	playlist server: playlistfs
	browse server: jukefs
	GUI: jukebox
The juke.rc script (installed, by default, in /rc/bin/juke) starts them all up.

To configure, adjust the DEFAULTMAP and ICONPATH in the central mkfile.
The default map is used by jukefs as the root of the descriptive database.
The iconpath is used by jukebox to find the icons.
