Ken Thompson created the Plan 9 file server
and maintained it for many years.
The cached WORM driver is based upon
Sean Quinlan's PhD. thesis and prototype.
Jim McKie maintained the IBM-PC-dependent code,
a thankless job.
Bruce Ellis modified the
.I 8c
compiler in 2004
to generate much faster code for common
.I vlong
operations, which made the 64-bit file server feasible.
Nigel Roles contributed support for the APC UPS
and the NCR/Symbios/LSI-Logic SCSI host adaptors.
