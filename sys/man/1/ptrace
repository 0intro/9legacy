.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ptrace
plots and dumps generic process traces previously retrieved from
.IR ptrace (3).
Unlike with
.IR trace (1)
and
.IR trace (3),
the tracing and traced machines can be of different architectures,
and tracing is designed for processes in general, and not just real-time ones.
.PP
Events are retrieved from
.IR file ,
which is a text file with trace events. Flag
.B -d
indicates that
.I file
uses the raw format provided by the
.IR ptrace (3)
device.
But note that
.I ptrace
stops reading upon EOF, which makes it unsuitable for reading
.IR ptrace (3)
directly.
.PP
By default, the program prints events to standard output in a readable format.
The output can be used later as input.
.PP
Under flag
.B -g
the program draws a plot that can be inspected using the mouse and
the keyboard. 
A new window
is used to plot the diagram if
.B -w
is given, otherwise, the program uses the window it runs on.
It is advisable to use
.B -w
if commands causing prints are also used.
Flag
.B -p
makes the program print events even when
.B -g
is given.
.PP
Typing
.LR q
makes the program quit.
.PP
In the plot, the left column shows pids and the machine they are running
on. Red lines indicate waiting processes, green lines ready processes, and
blue lines running processes. Traps and faults are shown below the process line
and system calls are shown above.
.PP
The plot scale reflects actual time. You might have too zoom in to
see some interesting events otherwise merged due to the scale.
Placing the mouse near a process line updates the
status information shown, including time.
.PP
Arrow keys can be used 
to zoom in (up), out (down), and to move left (left) and right (right).
A click on the left (or right) part of the top line with the mouse
moves left (or right).
A sweep with mouse button 1 zooms into the time window selected.
.PP
The
.LR Esc
key restarts the plot using the original position and scale.
.PP
A sweep with button 2 saves the events selected in the file
.BR ptrace.out .
A sweep with button 3
prints on the standard output
the events in the rectangle selected (excluding
processes out of the rectangle). Horizontal sweeps select the process
where the sweep happens.
.PP
A click with the mouse
button 3 plumbs the clicked event to the editor.
The file name used is
.B ptrace.out
when the input uses a device format.
.PP
The
.LR space
key freezes the statistics reported when moving the mouse.
.PP
The
.LR p
key prints the events currently shown in the window. Those too small
to be individually plotted are also printed.
.PP
The
.LR s
key saves the events shown into the file named
.BR ptrace.out .
.PP
.I Tron
is a helper to collect traces for commands. It executes
.I cmd
with
.I args
activating the trace for it (and descendant processes).
Flag
.B -f
selects an alternate tracing device.
.PP
Flag
.B -o
causes
.I tron
to read events from the trace device and dump the output to
.I file
in the format used by the device. Such output file can later be used
with
.I ptrace
to inspect what happen, and also to convert it to a textual format.
The program ceases collecting events one second
after the traced command exits.
.PP
.I Pm
is a profile-me program generating a deterministic load with the given numbers
of processes, rounds, etc.
.SH EXAMPLE
Capture a trace for a compilation:
.EX
term% troff -o tr.out mk all
.EE
.LP
Print the events contained in the trace.
.EX
term% ptrace -d tr.out
	00048526953    121 06 mk   Ready  Ready       4 0x0
	00048537030    121 04 mk   Run    Run         3 0x0
	...
.EE
.LP
This output can be saved and later used as input for
.IR 
.PP
Convert the dump to a textual format and run
.I ptrace
on it
using a different window, so we can
still use standard output for printing:
.EX
term% ptrace -d tr.out >tr.txt
term% ptrace -wg tr.txt

.SH BUGS
To avoid extra interference from the tracing tools, the device
does not block the reader, and thus the tools must poll the device.
.PP
To honor the plot scale, some events do not show up unless you
zoom enough; although the picture is still accurate.
.PP
Should probably replace
.IR trace (1).
