.I Mug
reads a Plan 9
.IR image (6)
from

(or standard input if there is no
.IR file )
and 
displays a working version of the icon
a gray ramp,
and a larger image (the `crop box'),
all derived from
.IR file .
Selecting
.L Write
from the button-3 menu will write the icon in
.IR face (6)
format to standard output.
.LP
Imagine a 3x3 grid on the crop box.  You can move an
edge or corner of the box by putting the mouse in the
corresponding section of the grid and dragging.
Dragging in the middle box in the grid translates the
crop box.  The mouse cursor changes to tell you where you are.
.LP
The bar in the gray ramp controls the map from picture
gray levels to the output levels.  The values along the
bar are mapped to 0 through 255 in the output.  You can
move the bar vertically by grabbing the midsection or
adjust the width by grabbing an endpoint.
.LP
The current icon is shown in the bottom left corner,
surrounded by eight small empty boxes.  You can save the
settings as they are by dragging the current icon into
one of the other boxes.  You can restore the settings by
dragging an icon from one of the periphery boxes into the middle.
