.TH CHGRP 1 
.SH NAME
chgrp \- change file group
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chgrp
[
.B -ou
]
.I group file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The group of
each named file
is changed to
.IR group ,
which should be a name known to the server holding the file.
.PP
A file's group can be changed by the file's owner, if the
owner is a member of the new group,
or by the leader of both
the file's current group and the new group.
.PP
The
.B -o
and
.B -u
option are synonyms; they specify that the
.I owner
is to be set, rather than the group.
They are ineffectual unless the file server is in the bootstrap
state that permits changing file ownership.
