.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Eve
is a null-terminated string containing the name of the owner of
the Plan 9 system (sometimes called the `host owner',
see
.IR cons (3)).
The identity is set on a terminal to the name of the user who logs in.
It is set on a CPU server to the
.I authid
obtained either from NVRAM or by a console prompt.
The initial process created by system initialisation is given the
.I eve
identity.
.PP
.I Iseve
returns true if the current user is
.IR eve .
Several drivers use
.I iseve
to check the caller's identity
before granting permission to perform certain actions.
For example, the console driver allows only the user
.I eve
to write a new identity into the
.B /dev/user
file.
The privileges are strictly local and do not extend into the network
(in particular, to file serversâ€”even ones running on the local machine).
