.TH KBDPUTC 9
.SH NAME
kbdputc, kbdq \- keyboard interface to \fIcons\fP(3)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ta \w'\f5extern\ \ \f1'u
.B
.B
void	kbdputc(Queue *q, int c)
.PP
.B
extern	Queue *kbdq;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the internal interface between
.IR cons (3)
and the platform-dependent keyboard driver.
Before calling any of these functions,
the global variable
.B kbdq
must be initialised;
.IR cons (3)
does not initialise it.
This is usually done during system initialisation by the keyboard driver's
.I kbdinit
or
.I kbdenable
function ,
as follows:
.IP
.EX
kbdq = qopen(4*1024, 0, 0, 0);
qnoblock(kbdq, 1);
.EE
.PP
.I Kbdputc
puts a Unicode character
.I c
(ie, a `rune')
on the given
.IR q ,
as a sequence of bytes in UTF-8 encoding
(see
.IR utf (6)).
It is up to the platform's keyboard driver to map a physical keyboard character,
or a combination of them (for instance, following
.IR keyboard (6))
to a given Unicode character.
