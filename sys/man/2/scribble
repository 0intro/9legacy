.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The scribble library implements simple character recognition.
All characters are drawn using a single stroke of the pen (mouse button 1)
as on a palmtop computer.
A reference card is in
.BR /sys/src/libscribble/quickref.gif .
.PP
The library is not really intended for standalone use.  Its primary
use is by the scribble graphical control (see
.IR control (2)).
.PP
.B Scribblealloc
allocates and returns an appropriately initialized
.B Scribble
structure:
.IP
.EX
.ta 4n +4n +4n +4n +4n +4n +4n +4n +4n +4n
#define	CS_LETTERS			0
#define	CS_DIGITS			1
#define	CS_PUNCTUATION	2

struct Scribble {
	/* private state */
	Point			*pt;
	int			ppasize;
	Stroke	   ps;
	Graffiti		*graf;
	int			capsLock;
	int			puncShift;
	int			tmpShift;
	int			ctrlShift;
	int			curCharSet;
};
.EE
.PP
This structure encodes the points making up the stroke
to be recognized, as well as the \f2character group\fP in which
the stroke should be searched.
.PP
There are three such groups:
.IR letters ,
.IR digits ,
and
.IR punctuation .
The current group is encoded in the
.B curCharSet
field of the
.B Scribble
structure.
Special strokes are recognized to switch between groups.
In addition, the charater recognized is influenced by
.I mode
parameters and modifies them.
These are identified by the
.BR capsLock ,
.BR puncShift ,
.BR tmpShift ,
and
.B ctrlShift
fields of the
.B Scribble
structure.
When
.B puncShift
is non-zero, the character is recognized in the punctuation
character set.
Similarly,
when the character recognized is printable and
.B ctrlShift
is set, the associated control character is returned as if the
control key were depressed,
and when the character is a letter and
.B capsLock
or
.B tmpShift
is set, the upper-case version is returned.
The
.B puncShift
and
.B tmpShift
flags are turned off
once a character has been recognized; the others are left set.
.PP
The character to be recognized is encoded as an array of pen_points in the
.B ps
field.
To allow easy drawing of the stroke as it is drawn,
the
.I pt
and
.I ppasize
fields are available to the application code for storing an array
of points for a call to
.B poly
(see
.IR draw (2)).
.PP
.I Recognize
recognizes the character provided in the
.B ps
field of the
.B Scribble
structure; it
returns the rune or zero if nothing was recognized.
.SH FILES
