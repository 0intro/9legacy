.SH DESCRIPTION
This include file documents the format of the
.IR ptrace (3)
device. The device reports trace events for processes with the
fields documented in the
.B PTraceevent
structure. Events are read using little endian format for all
values. The type of event is one of those in
.BR PTevent .
.PP
Traps report also system calls made. They have set in the
.B arg
field the
.B STrapRPF
or
.B STrapWPF
bit if they correspond to a read or write page fault, and the
.B STrapSC
bit if they correspond to a system call (OR'ed with the
system call number). For page faults, the
.B STrapMask
bits are set to the faulting address using the
endianness of the faulting system.
Otherwise the argument is the trap number.
.PP
The
.B SName
event uses the space of the argument to store up to 8 characters
with the process name for the pid reported in the event.
.PP
The
.B SSleep
state reports as its argument both the scheduling state for the
sleep (in the low byte) and the program counter for the kernel
(upper bytes, shifted).
