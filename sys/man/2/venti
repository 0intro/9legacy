The Venti library provides support for writing Venti servers and clients.
Other manual pages describe the library functions in detail.
.PP
.IR Venti-cache (2)
describes a simple in-memory block cache to help clients.
.PP
.IR Venti-conn (2)
describes routines for manipulating network connections
between Venti clients and servers.
.IR Venti-client (2)
and
.IR venti-server (2)
describe routines for writing clients
and servers on top of these.
.PP
.IR Venti-fcall (2)
describes the C representation of Venti protocol messages
and data structures.
It also describes routines that convert between the C representation
and the network and disk representations.
.PP
.IR Venti-file (2)
describes routines for writing clients that manipulate
Venti file trees
(see
.IR venti (6)).
.PP
.IR Venti-log (2)
describes routines to access in-memory log buffers
as well as the logging that is done automatically by
the library.
.PP
.IR Venti-mem (2)
describes wrappers around the canonical
.IR malloc (2)
routines that abort on error.
.PP
.IR Venti-packet (2)
describes routines for
