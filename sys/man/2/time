.TH TIME 2
.SH NAME
time, nsec \- time in seconds and nanoseconds since epoch
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <u.h>
.br
.B #include <libc.h>
.PP
.nf
.B
ulong time(long *tp)
.PP
.B
vlong nsec(void)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Both
.I time
and
.I nsec
return the time since the epoch 00:00:00 GMT, Jan. 1, 1970.
The return value of the former is in seconds and the latter in nanoseconds.
For
.IR time ,
if
.I tp
is not zero then
.BI * tp
is also set to the answer.
.PP
Times should be stored in and treated as
.BR ulong s,
or cast to
.B ulong
then stored in
.BR vlong s;
this extends the range of valid times into the year 2106.
Before subtraction,
times should be cast to
.BR vlong .
.PP
.I Time
simply calls
.I nsec
and returns the value divided by 1000000000.
.PP
.I Nsec
is a system call.
Previous implementations read
.BR /dev/bintime ,
opening that file when first called,
and maintaining a static file descriptor;
however,
the maintenance of file descriptors in the face
of process forks is overly complex and prone to error.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Sets

Programs should test for the exact
.I time
value
.B (ulong)-1
as a failure indication, not just for any negative value.
