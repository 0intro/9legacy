.B aux/accupoint
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mouse
queries a mouse on a serial or PS2 port for
its type and then configures the port and the
mouse to be used to control the cursor.
.PP
.I Port
can be either a port number (e.g. 
.B 0
or
.BR 1 )
or the string
.B ps2
or
.BR ps2intellimouse .
The initialization can be automated by setting
.BR mouseport
in
.IR plan9.ini (8),
which will enable a call to
.I mouse
in
.B termrc
(see
.IR cpurc (8)).
.PP
The option
.B -d
provides a default mouse type should
.B mouse
fail to determine it.  The
types are:
.IP C
Logitech type C mouse
.IP W
Logitech type W mouse
.IP M
Microsoft compatible mouse
.PP
The
.B -n
flag queries the mouse and reports its type but does not set the device type.
.PP
The
.B -b
flag sets the baud rate for communication; it is effectual only for serial mice.
.SH
.I Accupoint
is a process, to be used with
.IR pipefile (1),
that processes events from an AccuPoint II pointing device
with four buttons, such as on Toshiba Portégé 3440CT and 3480CT
laptops, converting events on the two extra buttons
(which appear as buttons 4 and 5 in the
.IR mouse (3)
interface) into a simulation of button 2.
These extra buttons on laptops are in turn simulations of Intellimouse
scrolling buttons and have peculiar properties: they generate
only `down' events that repeat automatically, like a keypad, in
an approximation of the Intellimouse scroll wheel.
.I Accupoint
overcomes this behavior to produce a reasonable approximation of
a normal mouse button 2:
it makes left button act like a regular button 2, but is slow to release (the
program must wait for a repeat time before it knows the button has been released),
while the right button generates a fast button 2 `click'.
To use
.IR accupoint ,
add a line like this to
.B /usr/$user/lib/profile
or to a system-dependent configuration script in
.B termrc
(see
.IR cpurc (8)):
.EX
.IP
pipefile -dr /bin/aux/accupoint /dev/mouse
.EE
.PP
Before running
.IR accupoint ,
the mouse should be configured as an
.B intellimouse
or
.BR ps2intellimouse .

.SH BUGS
Due to the limitations of
.IR pipefile (1),
when running
.I accupoint
it is difficult restart
.IR rio (1)
if it has exited.
