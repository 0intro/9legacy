.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Aquarela
provides
.SM CIFS
(once known as
.SM SMB\c
)
access to Plan 9 file servers.
It announces and subsequently listens on
.B tcp!*!445
for connections to the file hierarchies called `shares' by
.SM CIFS\c .
Users are authenticated with their
.SM APOP
secret (see
.IR auth (8)).
Each session is managed by a process running as the authenticated user.
Two persistent processes handle listening, session setup, and housekeeping.
.PP
An
.I aquarela
.SM CIFS
share corresponds to a directory under
.BR /n .
A client request for a specific share, say,
.BR share ,
causes
.I aquarela
to attempt a
.I 9fs
(in
.IR srv (4))
connection to the file server
.BR share .
If connection succeeds, a file hierarchy rooted at
.B /n/share
is presented to the client.
The client request fails otherwise.
Requests for the protocol equivalent of
.B /
are satisfied with a directory containing only the default share,
.BR local .
.PP
The options are:
.TF "-u "
.TP
.B -n
Enable limited
.SM NETBIOS
service.
.I Aquarela
will register with the `master browser' for
.I workgroup
and listen on
.B tcp!*!139
and
.B udp!*!13[7-9]
for
.SM NETBIOS
name resolution and session requests.
This works in tandem with a complete
.SM NETBIOS
master name server, like that provided by Unix
\fInmbd\fR(8).
.SM NETBIOS
is not required for
.SM CIFS
file service.
.TP
.BI -u " N
Send Unicode.
For
.IR N ,
.B 1
enables,
.B 0
disables Unicoding of file names and metadata.
There is no code page support, so
.I aquarela
emits
.SM UTF
if
.I N
is
.BR 0 .
.TP
.BI -w " workgroup
Set
.I workgroup
(or `primary domain') of server.
Default
.BR PLAN9 .
.PD
.SH EXAMPLE
To start
.SM CIFS
service on system
.BR plan9 :
.IP
.EX
% aquarela -u 1 &
.EE
.PP
To then make the
.B dump
filesystem available as drive
.B Y:
on a Windows machine:
.IP
.EX
C:\\>net use Y: \\\\plan9.example.com\\dump
.EE
.SH FILES
.TF /sys/log/aquarela
.TP
.B /n/local
Default
.SM CIFS
share
.TP
.B /sys/log/aquarela
Log file
.PD
.SH SOURCE
.B /sys/src/cmd/aquarela

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Log messages are appended to
.B /sys/log/aquarela
if it exists. The
.B -p
option prints them on standard output as well.
The
.B -d
option adds verbose output about
.I debug
to the log messages, where
.I debug
is one of:
.TF any-smb-name
.TP
.B allcmds
All
.SM CIFS
requests and responses.
.TP
.B tids
Connections and disconnections per-share.
.TP
.B sids
Creation and deletion of search ids.
.TP
.B fids
Creation and deletion of file ids.
.TP
.B rap2
.SM RAP
calls.
.TP
.B find
Transaction2 find commands.
.TP
.B query
Transaction2 query commands.
.TP
.B sharedfiles
All files opened.
.TP
.B poolparanoia
Draconian error checking in memory allocator.
.TP
.B sessions
Connections and disconnections on server.
.TP
.B rep
Regular expression conversions.
.TP
.B locks
Locking activity.
.TP
.I any-smb-name
Debug only
.B SMB_
requests or
.B transaction2
sub-requests
(e.g.,
.B SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX
or
.BR SMB_TRANS2_FIND_FIRST2 )
matching symbolic name
.I any-smb-name.
.TP
.BI 0x nn
Debug only messages with hexadecimal id
.BI 0x nn.
.PD
.SH BUGS
The first connection attempt to a share sometimes fails erroneously - try again.
The share disk space reported by some clients is inaccurate.
Some clients can't rename directories.
Write attempts without sufficient permissions fail (correctly), but appear on client to temporarily succeed.
.PP
This program should probably be named
.IR cifsserver .
